### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 
I'm Mike, a full stack software engineer who transitioned from creative storytelling into engineering high-impact web applications. Since graduating from App Academy in 2021, Iâ€™ve built and scaled educational platforms, real-time content management systems, and game engines used by millions.

Whether crafting component libraries in React, optimizing PostgreSQL queries, or mentoring new developers, I bring creativity, structure, and energy to every line of code.
 
My work has spanned the education and gaming sectors, where I've developed interactive learning modules, curriculum-aligned games, and real-time collaborative tools. These experiences have sharpened my ability to build engaging, reliable, and accessible software for diverse audiences.
